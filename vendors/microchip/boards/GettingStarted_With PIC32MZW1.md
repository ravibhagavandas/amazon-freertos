### Monitoring MQTT Messages on the Cloud

You can use the MQTT client in the AWS IoT console to monitor the messages that your device sends to the AWS Cloud.

**To subscribe to the MQTT topic with the AWS IoT MQTT client**

1. Sign in to the [AWS IoT console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iotv2/).
2. In the navigation pane, choose  **Test**  to open the MQTT client.
3. In  **Subscription topic** , enter  **iotdemo/#** , and then choose  **Subscribe to topic**. 
This will enable you to see the periodically published messages by the MQTT Hello World example.

## **10. Troubleshooting**

If no messages appear in the AWS IoT console, try the following:
1. Open a terminal window to view the logging output of the sample. This can help you determine
what is going wrong.

2. Below picture shows the highlighted debug log
    * If log1 is not print, check that your Wi-Fi credentials are valid
    * If log2 is not print, check that your AP settings are correct
    * If log3 is not print, check that your AWS IoT credentials are valid
